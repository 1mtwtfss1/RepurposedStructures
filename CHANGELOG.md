## (V.1.0.1 Changes) (1.15.2 Minecraft)



##### Config: 

-Added a config option to allow the option to turn off replacing Vanilla Stronghold with this mod's Stronghold. 



##### Structures/Features: 

-Fixed Crash when loading this mod with another mod that affects the biome's list of features. 

-Fixed bug where Dungeons fused together will sometimes fail to set their spawner's mob and so, they will end up with a Pig Spawner by default instead of the correct mob spawner.

-Fixed vines not generating correctly or at all in Dark Forest Dungeons.

-Added Badlands Wells to Badlands biomes with a small chance of Gold Ores inside like it is coins tossed into a well!
