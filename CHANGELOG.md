## (V.1.2.0 Changes) (1.15.2 Minecraft)



##### Config: 

-Rename allowExtraSilverfishSpawnerSH config entry to allowExtraSpawnersSH as it will apply to Nether Strongholds too which sues Blaze Spawners instead of Silverfish spawners.

-Fixed bug where setting useVanillaStronghold config to true made using Eye of Ender and /locate command fail when trying to find a Vanilla Stronghold.


##### Structures: 

-Mossy Stone Wells now are properly waterlogged when underwater.

-Added Nether styled Strongholds to Nether biomes! They use a mix of Nether Bricks, Magma, and Black Terracotta for the majority of the structure. Silverfish Spawners are replaced with Blaze Spawners and all non-library chests contains Nether Fortress loot.
