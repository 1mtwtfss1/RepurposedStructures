### **(V.3.3.2 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)**

##### Dungeons:
Added shulkerBoxInEndDungeons config option to let users make End Dungeons spawn chests instead of SHulker Boxes if set to false.
 Configuredfeatures are unable to be overridden by datapack due to a bad Forge hook placement. Hence this config option as a workaround.


### **(V.3.3.1 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)**

##### Villages:
Adjusted some zombie terminator pool files so that they are used now for many zombie variant RS Villages.

Adjusted many RS Village's terminator pieces to make absolutely sure they cannot spawn the wrong village's street to prevent other village's buildings from spawning in extremely rare edge cases.

Fixed Zombie Warped Village spawning non-zombified Piglins.

##### Mod Compat:
Added limit on piece spawning for future mod compat datapacks with Tidbits, Reosurceful Bees, and PneumaticCraft: Repressurized.
 I'm just future proofing a bit. 


### **(V.3.3.0 Changes) (1.16.5 Minecraft)**

##### Villages:
Added Mushroom Villages for Mushroom category biomes!

Fixed Mountains Villages very very rarely spawn Savanna Village pieces.

Fixed Swamp and Giant Tree Taiga Villages very very rarely spawn Plains Village pieces.

Removed a lot of the randomly placed Red Sand blocks from Badlands Villages to make them look a lot cleaner.

##### Mod Compat:
Houses added to RS's villages from the official mod compat datapacks will now only spawn more more than once for a single village.
 This will greatly help prevent RS's villages from becoming overloaded with multiple modded houses from the datapacks.
