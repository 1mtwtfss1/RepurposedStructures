# | Repurposed Structures changelog |


   
## (V.1.2.3 Changes) (1.15.2 Minecraft)
  
##### Structures: 

-Moved a Nether Brick block that was placed wrong and basically broke the Nether Temple's puzzle mechanism.

   
## (V.1.2.2 Changes) (1.15.2 Minecraft)
  
##### Structures: 

-Fixed crash with generating modded Strongholds when the world already has a partially made Vanilla Stronghold.

-In Stronghold's Storage Room, the Torch is now moved down one block so it rests on the Mob Spawner instead of disappearing and becoming a lit air space.

-Greatly reduced amount of Magma Blocks in Nether Temple.


  
## (V.1.2.1 Changes) (1.15.2 Minecraft)
  
##### Config: 

-Fixed config entry name for well spawnrates. It now says wellSpawnrate instead of dungeonSpawnrate.


  
## (V.1.2.0 Changes) (1.15.2 Minecraft)



##### Config: 

-Rename allowExtraSilverfishSpawnerSH config entry to allowExtraSpawnersSH as it will apply to Nether Strongholds too which uses Blaze Spawners instead of Silverfish spawners.

-Fixed bug where setting useVanillaStronghold config to true made using Eye of Ender and /locate command fail when trying to find a Vanilla Stronghold.

-Changed useVanillaStronghold config value to be false by default.
  
-Changed default value for Well spawnrate config from 800 to 350.
  
-Added config value to allow disabling Bells from spawning in Wells.


##### Structures: 

-Added Nether styled Strongholds to Nether biomes! They use a mix of Nether Bricks, Red Nether bricks, Magma, and Black Terracotta for the majority of the structure. Silverfish Spawners are replaced with Blaze Spawners and all non-library chests contains Nether Fortress loot.

-Added Nether styled Jungle Temples to Nether biomes! They use a mix of Nether Bricks, Red Nether bricks, Magma, and Black Terracotta for the majority of the structure. They also contain a Pigmen spawner, unique chest loot, and the traps uses Harming tipped arrows.

-Fixed bug where Nether Well's 5 blocks under lava are always the same blocks picked instead of being a mix of Nether Bricks, Quartz Ore, and Chiseled Quartz Block.
  
-Nether Wells now has less of a chance of spawning buried in nether terrain.
  
-Mossy Stone Wells now are properly waterlogged when underwater.
