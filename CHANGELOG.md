### **(V.6.0.0 Changes) (1.19.0 Minecraft)**

#### Major:
Updated to 1.19! 
 Note: previous config datapacks will not work as many changes were done to structure json by Mojang.
 The updated RS Config datapack for 1.19 will be posted here: https://github.com/TelepathicGrunt/RepurposedStructures-Fabric/releases/tag/2.0.1

#### Config: 
The Dungeons and Wells config files that used to be in the mod config folder are now deleted. 
 Instead, they are now made with json and can be disabled by editing the config datapack listed above.

#### Dungeons:

#### Mineshafts:
Swamp Mineshaft now uses blocks from Mangrove Swamp and will spawn in that biome.

#### Villages:
